- **Code Reviewers**: Quickly extract project module code and leverage AI for quality reviews and optimization suggestions
- **Technical Educators**: Explain code structures and implementation details more effectively as teaching aids
- **Open Source Contributors**: Rapidly familiarize yourself with new project codebases, lowering barriers to contribution

## üéØ Key Application Scenarios

This tool allows you to easily pass code context to AI assistants for:

- **Code Learning**: Understanding complex project structures and mechanisms, improving learning efficiency
- **Development Assistance**: Getting more accurate code modification and feature implementation suggestions
- **Code Reviews**: Conducting automated quality checks and performance optimization analysis
- **Refactoring Guidance**: Receiving code improvement suggestions based on complete context
- **Problem Diagnosis**: Helping AI precisely locate issues by providing the complete environment

All features run locally without internet connection, ensuring the privacy and security of your code.

## üí° Core Use Cases

### 1. Code Learning & Analysis

Easily let AI help you understand how complex codebases work:

1. **Select Target Project Directory**: Open the project you want to analyze
2. **Copy Complete Project Structure**: Use the "Copy Directory Tree" function to help AI understand the overall architecture
3. **Provide Core Code Files**: Select key files and use "Copy Path and Code" to provide all code at once
4. **Ask AI for Analysis**: Request AI to analyze code structure, explain how it works, or suggest a learning path

> Understanding a complex open-source project used to take days. Now you can get an overview and analysis of key parts from AI, greatly improving learning efficiency!

### 2. Code Modification & Development

Get AI programming assistance without disrupting your existing workflow:

1. **Locate Modules Needing Changes**: Find relevant files through the visual tree structure
2. **Export Related Code Context**: Select multiple related files simultaneously (e.g., models, controllers, and views)
3. **Describe Modification Requirements**: Clearly explain to AI what functionality you want to implement or what problem needs fixing
4. **Get Complete Implementation Plan**: AI will provide accurate code modification suggestions based on the complete context

> Compared to single-file editor integrations, this approach provides more complete project context, resulting in more accurate and actionable code suggestions

### 3. Code Review & Refactoring

Let AI become your code review assistant:

1. **Select Module for Review**: Box-select all files in a functional module
2. **Copy All Related Code with One Click**: Include complete implementation details and file paths
3. **Request AI Review**: Get feedback on code quality, potential issues, and improvement suggestions
4. **Implement Refactoring Suggestions**: Apply optimization solutions provided by AI

> If the total code is under 5,000 lines, you can copy it all to mainstream AI assistants for comprehensive analysis, faster and more thorough than traditional code reviews

### Local Execution, Privacy Protection

- **Completely Offline Operation**: The software runs locally, requires no internet connection, and never uploads any code
- **Privacy Protection**: Your code only leaves your computer when you actively copy it
- **Compatible with Any AI Assistant**: You're free to choose which AI service to use, with complete control over code sharing
