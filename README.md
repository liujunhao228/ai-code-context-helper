## üìù Introduction

AI Code Context Helper is a lightweight desktop application designed for developers collaborating with AI assistants. It provides a visual representation of project structures and enables quick, selective export of file paths and code content to the clipboard, streamlining code communication with ChatGPT, Claude, and other AI assistants.

As a supplementary tool, it doesn't aim to replace existing editors or IDEs but focuses specifically on solving the code context transfer challenge in AI programming collaboration. Compared to integrated AI code editors, it offers advantages in simplicity, low learning curve, independence from specific AI services, and minimal resource usage, integrating seamlessly with various development environments.

## üîë Shortcuts and Special Features

- **Ctrl+C**: Copy path and code of selected files
- **Ctrl+B**: Copy filename of selected files
- **Ctrl+F**: Open selected folder in file explorer
- **Ctrl+T**: Open command line in selected folder
- **Ctrl+2**: Global hotkey to show/hide the application from anywhere
- **Tree State Preservation**: Application remembers the expanded state of each project directory between sessions

## üí° Usage Tips

### Best Practice: Combining Project Structure with Code Content

For better AI comprehension of your project, follow these steps:

1. **First Share Project Structure**:

   - Select the root directory and use the "Copy Tree" function
   - Paste the directory tree to the AI to provide overall project architecture

2. **Then Share Key Files**:

   - Select relevant files based on your requirements (multiple files or directories)
   - Use "Copy Path and Code" to provide all necessary files at once

3. **Reference File Paths in Requirements**:
   - Example: "Please modify the `authenticate` method in `models/user.py` to add two-factor authentication"
   - Clear path references help AI locate relevant code accurately

### Module-Level Modifications

When modifying an entire functional module:

1. Select the module directory (e.g., `authentication/` folder)
2. Right-click and choose "Copy Path and Code" to include all files in the directory
3. Describe to the AI: "Please analyze this authentication module and suggest improvements"

> For codebases under 5,000 lines, you can copy all code directly to AI assistants like Claude or ChatGPT for code review and get complete modified code. This is essentially pair programming with AI - efficiency improves with your coding and requirements description skills.
